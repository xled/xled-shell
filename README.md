# XLED-SHELL - unofficial control of Twinkly - Smart Decoration LED lights

XLED is a set of bash (shell) scripts to control
[Twinkly](https://www.twinkly.com/) - Smart Decoration LED lights for
Christmas.

Official materials says:

    Twinkly is a LED light device that you can control via smartphone. It
    allows you to play with colouful and animated effects, or create new ones.
    Decoration lights, not suitable for household illumination.

Since its [Kickstarter
project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/twinkly/twinkly-smart-decoration-for-your-christmas)
in 2016 many products were introduced with varying properties and features.
Most notably products released since September 2019 are identified as
Generation II. Older products are since then referred as Generation I.

This is free software available under MIT license.

Depends on following binaries:

* `bash` version 4 or higher
* `head` and `base64` - usually part of coreutils package
* `jq`

Firmware version-aware script that queries most of known endpoints from
[unofficial documentation](https://xled-docs.readthedocs.io) and writes whole
endpoint paths in otput:

```
$ ./all 192.168.4.1
```

Wrapper of previous script that also writes output to filename that consists of
device name and firmware version:

```
$ ./gather 192.168.4.1
```

Example of high level wrapper:

```
$ ./set-demo 192.168.4.1
```

Another example 

```
$ echo -e 'Hello!' | ./set-echo 192.168.4.1
```

which requires `awk` to escape newlines. Other control characters from U+0000
through U+001F are not escaped and `jq` complains.

Example of low level get where second argument is an endpoint without
`/xled/v1/` prefix:

```
$ ./get 192.168.4.1 gestalt
```

If standard output (stdout) of a script is associated with a terminal or if it
is run with environment variable `XLED_DEBUG=1`, scripts shows more verbose
output on standard error output (stderr) and runs `jq` to pretty format output.
Run with `XLED_DEBUG=0` to get only response from the device.

All shell scripts are expected to be run from current directory because they
sometimes they run other scripts and expects them in the same directory.

# Configure a device through Bluetooth to connect to a WiFi

This option is available on for second generation devices.

1. Follow guide on Twinkly site to [Connect Twinkly Generation II to your Local
   Wi-fi](https://help.twinkly.com/en/help/how-do-i-set-up-my-generation-ii-device):

        Press and hold the button on the controller until the light turns to a
        solid CYAN color (about 5 seconds). This indicates that Twinkly is
        ready to be paired via Bluetooth to your phone.

2. Get MAC address of Twinkly's bluetooth adapter:

   ```
   $ sudo hcitool lescan
   ```

   and look for a device with `Twinkly_` prefix

3. Run:

   ```
   $ ./configure-wifi-over-bluetooth-sta 98:f4:ab:1b:b2:10 'home' 'Twinkly'
   ```

   where `98:f4:ab:1b:b2:10` is replaced with the MAC address obtained from
   previous step, `home` is SSID of your WiFi, `password` is its password.

This script script accepts also `XLED_DEBUG=2` for more verbose output. Script
requires following binaries available:

* `python3`
* `timeout` - usually part of coreutils package
* `gatttool`

## Why?

This is a quick way to test Twinkly API.
